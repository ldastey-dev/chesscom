# Architecture Review

## Role

You are a **Principal Architect** reviewing a pull request for architectural soundness. You evaluate whether the change respects established boundaries, dependency direction, and structural patterns -- and whether it moves the codebase toward or away from its intended architecture.

---

## Objective

Review the code changes in this pull request for architectural alignment, boundary violations, and structural impact. Apply the criteria from `standards/aws-well-architected.md` where relevant. Produce focused, actionable findings with specific recommendations. Every finding references a file path and line number.

---

## Scope

Review **only the changes in this PR**. Evaluate:

- New or modified module, service, or layer boundaries
- Dependency direction and coupling changes
- API surface changes (new endpoints, contracts, DTOs)
- Configuration and environment management changes
- Data flow and integration point changes

---

## Review Checklist

### Dependency Direction

- [ ] Dependencies point inward toward the domain -- infrastructure and UI depend on the domain, never the reverse
- [ ] No new circular dependencies introduced between modules or layers
- [ ] High-level policy modules do not reference low-level infrastructure modules directly
- [ ] New dependencies injected through abstractions, not constructed inline

### Layer Boundaries

- [ ] Domain logic free from framework, database, and infrastructure concerns
- [ ] No business rules in controllers, handlers, or infrastructure code
- [ ] Use cases are explicit, testable units -- not scattered across layers
- [ ] DTOs or mapping used at boundaries -- internal domain objects not leaked to consumers

### Coupling and Cohesion

- [ ] Change is localised -- does not require coordinated changes across unrelated modules
- [ ] New code is cohesive -- related concepts grouped together, unrelated concerns separated
- [ ] No inappropriate intimacy -- modules not reaching into each other's internals
- [ ] Public API surface is minimal -- only what consumers need is exposed

### API Design

- [ ] New endpoints follow existing naming conventions and patterns
- [ ] Contract changes are backward compatible or versioned appropriately
- [ ] Error responses are structured, consistent, and do not leak internals
- [ ] Idempotency considered for write operations

### Configuration and Environment

- [ ] Configuration externalised -- no environment-specific values in code
- [ ] Feature flags used for gradual rollout where appropriate
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs, connection strings, or environment assumptions

### Well-Architected Alignment

**Operational Excellence**
- [ ] Change is deployable and rollback-able via the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Runbooks and documentation updated if operational procedures changed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting considered for new operations

**Security**
- [ ] No new attack surface introduced without corresponding controls (defer detail to `review/security.md`)
- [ ] IAM and access control follows least privilege

**Reliability**
- [ ] Change does not introduce single points of failure
- [ ] External calls have timeouts, retries with backoff, and circuit breakers where appropriate
- [ ] Mutating operations are idempotent
- [ ] Health checks updated if new dependencies introduced

**Performance Efficiency**
- [ ] Scaling implications considered (statelessness, connection management, async where appropriate)
- [ ] No unbounded queries, result sets, or collection growth
- [ ] Connection and client reuse -- not recreated per request

**Cost Optimisation**
- [ ] Cost implications of new resources, services, or dependencies evaluated
- [ ] Cache-first patterns used before making network requests where applicable
- [ ] No unnecessary API calls, polling loops, or redundant data movement
- [ ] Compute right-sized -- not speculatively over-provisioned
- [ ] New cloud resources tagged appropriately for cost allocation

**Sustainability**
- [ ] Only necessary data fetched -- no over-fetching or full-table scans where a subset suffices
- [ ] Event-driven patterns preferred over polling where feasible
- [ ] Lean dependencies -- no heavyweight frameworks added where lightweight alternatives exist
- [ ] Build and test pipeline efficiency maintained (caching, incremental builds)
